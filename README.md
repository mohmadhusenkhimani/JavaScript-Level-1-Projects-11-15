# JavaScript Level-1 Projects (11–15)

This repository contains the final set of Level-1 JavaScript projects (11 to 15).  
These projects focus on building strong fundamentals in JavaScript using simple logic, functions, loops, strings, arrays, and console-based interaction.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. To-Do List (Console Version)
A minimal task-management tool that runs inside the console.
- Add tasks
- View tasks
- Delete tasks  
Great practice for arrays and CRUD logic.

### 2. String Reversal Tool
Reverses the user-entered string using split(), reverse(), and join().

### 3. Vowel Counter
Counts vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from any input string.
Helps improve conditional logic and string traversal.

### 4. Tip Calculator
Calculates:
- Tip Amount  
- Total Bill  
Based on user-provided bill amount and tip percentage.

### 5. Age Calculator
Calculates exact age using date of birth.
